# FlexNav jQuery Plugin

### A Device Agnostic Approach to Complex Site Navigation with Support for Touch and Keyboard Accessibility

* * *
### The Details

* [View Demo](http://jasonweaver.name/lab/flexiblenavigation/)
* [Single page site with fixed navigation demo](http://jasonweaver.name/lab/flexiblenavigation/single-page-pattern.html)

A mobile-first example of using media queries and jQuery to make a decent site menu with drop downs. Special attention is paid to touch screens using touch events and tap targets. This is something I use to test different navigation techniques and may change as I iterate over different solutions to the problem. Basically I want a simple model to build upon when working on sites from scratch.

**Note:** If you find a bug, please [file an issue](https://github.com/indyplanets/flexnav/issues) and note device and browser versions

### Features
* Multiple nested sub menus
* Tap targets to reveal sub menus for touch screens
* Hover reveal for desktop
* Keyboard tab input accessibility
* Use class `.one-page` on the `body`, `.menu-button`, and `ul.flexnav` for single page fixed menu
* Use with hoverIntent jQuery plugin

### Browser Support
* IE7-10
* Latest Safari
* Latest Chrome
* Latest FireFox
* Android 2.2 to Latest
* Mobile Safari

* * *
### Usage

Start with a simple unordered list, adding in the class and data attributes:

	<ul class="flexnav" data-breakpoint="800"> <li>...</li> </ul>

Add the small screen menu button somewhere outside your navigation markup:

	<div class="menu-button">Menu</div>
		
For a single page site with id anchors, add `.one-page` class to `<body>`, `.menu-button`, and FlexNav `<ul>`:

	<ul class="flexnav one-page" data-breakpoint="800"> <li>...</li> </ul>	
								
Add flexnav.css to the head of your document
		
		<link href="css/flexnav.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" / >
		
Add jquery.flexnav.min.js before closing body tag and after jQuery
		
		<script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.flexnav.min.js"></script>
		
Initialize

		<script>
			$(".flexnav").flexNav();
		</script>		

### Options
	'animationSpeed' : '250', // default for drop down animation speed
	'transitionOpacity': true, // default for opacity animation
	'buttonSelector': '.menu-button', // default menu button class name
	'hoverIntent': false, // Change to true for use with hoverIntent plugin
	'hoverIntentTimeout': 150 // hoverIntent default timeout
